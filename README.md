# automatic install
clone the repo, type ```cd mybspwmdots``` then ```sh ./installer-[yourdisto].sh```


# manual install

Put the ```bspwmrc``` file in ```~/.config/bspwm```, if this directory does not exist, create it.
put the ```config.ini``` file in ```~/.config/polybar```, if this directory does not exist, create it.

My sxhkdrc file is stock but with rvxt swapped for alacritty (alacritty >>>> rxvt), but if you want to use it, put it in ```~/.config/sxhkd", again, if this directory doesn't exist, create it.

Once fully cloned, to install the packages listed in the .sh file of your respective distrobution, type ```cd mybspwmdots``` and then ```sh ./yourdistro.sh```, and enter your password.
